# CSCE421 Final Project - Restaurant Revenue Prediction

## Goal
Running various machine learning approaches on a Kaggle dataset consisting of 137 restaurants in the training set and a test set with 100000 restaurants. The goal is to predict the revenue of the restaurants. The data columns are obfuscated other than the date that it was open, the city, the size of the city, and the type of restaurant. The information also states that the revenue in the training set is transformed to also be obfuscated.

## Methodology
- Performing EDA and feature engineering
- Catboost, Random Forest, ElasticNet, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Lasso, LightGBM, Linear Regression, Ridge, SVR, XGBoost, and Ensemble Stacking
